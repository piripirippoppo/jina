# Exercise 1: 

## Due Date: Wednesday, January 15, 2020 11:59 PM
## Objectives: To get familiar with writing our own components and gain practice with our git workflow for distributiing course materials and submitting projects.

## Specifications/Requirements
1. Inside of the `componenets directory` you will find the file `ColorSwatch.js`. This is where you will do the majority of your work. We have provided you with the structure of the UI and the vast majority of the styling. The principal functionality of the application you are building is taking an input and updating the state of your component to equal the input of the user. If that input corressponds to either a rgb value (e.g. #fff) or a valid color property value (e.g. red) then the final `<View>` element inside of your render function will reflect the color you entered. Additionally, you will have to implement the `Reset State` button functionality that will clear the property of the state object where you are keeping track of the user input. You will also need to render the title of the app which should be "Exercise 1 Color Swatch" by reading it from the components state.  
We have provided you with a list of `TODO` hints throughout the code but they are not exhaustive - somethings we left for you to still think about and decide what needs to be done to implement the exercise successfully. Lastly, none of the React Native components we are using are specific to either Android or iOS platforms so you you can run your solution in either emulator.
