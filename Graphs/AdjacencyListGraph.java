/**
 * <p>{@link AdjacencyListGraph} is a {@link Graph} implemented as an adjacency list, i.e a one-dimensional array of linked lists,
 * where A(i) is a linked list containing the neighbors of node i and the corresponding edges' weights. <b>The neighbors of a given node are defined as the nodes it  points to</b> (if any). </p>
 *
 * <p>Other implementations besides linked lists are possible (e.g BSTs over the weight of the edge), yet for this project we
 * will keep it simple and stick to that basic implementation. One of its advantages is that, because the lists do not need
 * to be sorted in any way, the insertion of a new edge is a O(1) operation (find the list corresponding to the source node in O(1)
 * and add the new list node up front.</p>
