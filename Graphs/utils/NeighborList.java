/**
 * <p>{@link NeighborList} is a simple linked list with head and tail references. It offers constant-time addition to the
 * front and the back. It also offers methods for searching and deletion.</p>
 *
 * <p>The only reason for the existence of this list is because {@link projects.graph.AdjacencyListGraph} contains a single-dimensional
 * raw array over lists of nodes. Creating a raw array of generics in Java is a pain, with several castings that are usually unsafe and
 * flagged by the compiler as such (or making the runtime vulnerable). See the writeup for more.</p>
 *
 * <p>Finally, note that this class has been declared {@link Iterable} over {@link Neighbor} instances. This means that it implements a
 * method called {@link #iterator()} which returns an instance of {@link Iterator} over instances of the class {@link Neighbor}. As a result,
 * this list can be looped through using a &quot;for-each&quot; loop. To make the iterator &quot;fail-fast&quot;, we make sure that
 * calls to {@link Iterator#next()} after calls to insertion or removal methods throw an instance of {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException}.
 * If you want more information on &quot;fail-fast&quot; and &quot;fail-safe&quot; iterators, a good place to start would be the documentation of
 * {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException}, located online <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ConcurrentModificationException.html">here</a>.</p>
