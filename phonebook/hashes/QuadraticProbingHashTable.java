/**
 * <p>{@link QuadraticProbingHashTable} is an Openly Addressed {@link HashTable} which uses <b>Quadratic
 * Probing</b> as its collision resolution strategy. Quadratic Probing differs from <b>Linear</b> Probing
 * in that collisions are resolved by taking &quot; jumps &quot; on the hash table, the length of which
 * determined by an increasing polynomial factor. For example, during a key insertion which generates
 * several collisions, the first collision will be resolved by moving 1^2 + 1 = 2 positions over from
 * the originally hashed address (like Linear Probing), the second one will be resolved by moving
 * 2^2 + 2= 6 positions over from our hashed address, the third one by moving 3^2 + 3 = 12 positions over, etc.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>By using this collision resolution technique, {@link QuadraticProbingHashTable} aims to get rid of the
 * &quot;key clustering &quot; problem that {@link LinearProbingHashTable} suffers from. Leaving more
 * space in between memory probes allows other keys to be inserted without many collisions. The tradeoff
 * is that, in doing so, {@link QuadraticProbingHashTable} sacrifices <em>cache locality</em>.</p>
